🗒️ YAD-Based Linux Notes App – Feature Overview & Architecture
Designing a lightweight notes app powered by YAD (Yet Another Dialog), PostgreSQL, and GitHub integration. This approach keeps everything shell-script friendly, GUI-capable, and terminal-native for Linux environments.

✅ Core Features (YAD-Driven)
🧑‍💼 User Management
Login & Registration:

Use YAD forms to capture usernames, passwords, and optional roles (via dropdown/radio buttons).

Store user data securely in PostgreSQL with hashed passwords (e.g., SHA-256 via openssl or bcrypt with Python).

📝 Note Management
Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD):

YAD form for creating/editing notes (Title, Tags, Content via text area).

List notes in YAD tables/dialogs with buttons for View/Edit/Delete.

Note Organization:

Support categorization using dropdowns or tree views for folders/tags.

Rich Text Formatting:

Add buttons or checkboxes for bold/italic formatting (saved using Markdown or simple markup).

🗃️ Database Integration
Use PostgreSQL to store:

Users, notes, tags, folders, version metadata.

Interface via:

Bash with psql, or Python for more advanced operations.

🔍 Search & Filter
YAD search bar for keyword input.

Display filtered results dynamically using list dialogs.

Optional: Tag or category filters using checklists/dropdowns.

🌐 GitHub Integration
Configure Git settings using YAD forms (repo name, branch, token if needed).

Automate:

git add, git commit, and git push using shell scripts.

Include a “Push to GitHub” button in the main menu.

🚀 Enhanced Features
🧾 Version Control (Git)
Track note changes using Git.

Show commit history with YAD list dialogs.

Option to revert to previous versions using Git checkout/reset.

🤝 Collaboration
Export/import notes as JSON or plain text.

Shareable via file transfer or GitHub.

Import feature using YAD file picker dialog.

🔒 Encryption
Encrypt individual notes with gpg.

Allow users to toggle encryption/decryption in YAD dialogs.

Store encrypted blobs in the database.

🛠️ Backup & Restore
Backup notes to file (JSON/XML).

Restore notes using a YAD file selector.

Optionally integrate cloud backups (see below).

🔔 Notifications
Use notify-send for:

Reminders

Task alerts

Backup reminders

YAD dialog to configure custom reminder times.

✍️ Markdown Support
Notes saved using Markdown.

Preview notes rendered via pandoc in a YAD display dialog or HTML viewer.

🎨 Theming & Customization
YAD settings menu for:

Light/Dark themes

Font size & color preferences

Store settings in a simple config file (~/.config/notesapp/settings.conf).

📴 Offline Mode
Fallback to SQLite or local JSON cache when offline.

Sync with PostgreSQL when connection is restored.

📊 Analytics Dashboard
Show note usage stats using YAD info dialogs:

Most active notes

Edits over time

User activity patterns

Generate reports with Python or shell scripts.

☁️ Cloud & External Integration
Use YAD file pickers to:

Upload to Google Drive or Dropbox (via API or CLI tools).

Export notes as:

PDF, Word, Markdown via pandoc.

💻 Command-Line Support
Full CLI capability for power users:

Add/edit/delete notes

GitHub upload

Database backup

🧪 Example Workflow
Main Menu (YAD)
Buttons: Create Note, View Notes, Search, Settings, Push to GitHub

Create Note
YAD form:

Title, Tags, Category (dropdown), Content (text area)

View Notes
List of titles in YAD list dialog

Selecting one opens options:

View, Edit, Delete, Export

GitHub Upload
Dialog to:

Set repo/branch

Confirm upload

Show latest commit status
